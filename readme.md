# index of worksheets

I have been put on 3 weeks furlough, so I am taking the time to make an evolving index of the worksheets that are accessible on grubmz6v. I may copy all gist worksheets & imgur images into folders in this repository - that seems a convenient thing to do at the moment but I don't know if I will be able to in the time available.
